XO Game

Overview

XO Game is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking X or O in empty cells, and the first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
